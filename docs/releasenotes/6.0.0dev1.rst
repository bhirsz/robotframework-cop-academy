Deprecate return_status report with quality gates
--------------------------------------------------

Internal report ``return_status`` is now deprecated. Together with it ``quality_gates`` parameters is no
longer available.

While this feature offered great flexibility on deciding on return status of Robocop, it was rarely used and
often misunderstood. There is no need to artificially set limits on number of issues that are acceptable before
failing pipeline after all - we either get an issue we need to fix or not. If the issue is not relevant, it
can be disabled.

Instead, Robocop will return following exit codes:

- 0, if no rule violations were found
- 1, if violations were found
- 2, if Robocop terminated abnormally
