Breaking changes
=================

return_status report is now optional
-------------------------------------

Return status (exit code) of Robocop depended on internal, always enabled `return_status` report. It was calculated
based on parameter `quality_gate`. Default configuration::

    quality_gate = {
        'E': 0,
        'W': 0,
        'I': -1
    }

It means that any error or warning will count towards exit code. Information messages by default were not counted
towards exit code. Actual exit code is number of issues over set limit, up to 255 (for example with 'W': 100 and 105
warnings, exit code will be 5).

This behaviour wasn't clear to most, and makes Robocop unpredictable when run in CI/CD pipelines. That's why we are
now making `return_status` report optional. It means that now exit code follows different logic:

- 0, if no rule violations were found
- 1, if violations were found
- 2, if Robocop terminated abnormally

It is possible to always return 0, ignoring any violations, with new ``--exit-zero`` flag. The previous behaviour
can be reproduced by simply enabling ``return_status`` report again::

    robocop checks --reports return_status

compare_runs report is replaced with --compare
-----------------------------------------------

``compare_runs`` was special report that had to be enabled in order to compare reports results from current run
with previous runs. It was bit of a workaround, that's why it was removed.

To compare results, use ``--compare`` flag::

    robocop check --compare

Remember that you still need results from previous run (saved with ``--persistent``) and comparison is done on results
from the reports. Full example::

    robocop check --persistent --compare --reports all
