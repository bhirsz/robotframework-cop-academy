==============
Robocop2 6.0
==============

Robocop 6.0 is major release of both Robocop and Robotidy (!) tools.

Although this is the 6th major version of Robocop, the scope of changes is larger than ever before.
Nearly all core functionality has been rewritten, refactored, or replaced. Please make sure to review all the breaking
changes, as most of the previous commands or configuration files will be compatible with this release.

Merging the tools
==================

We have decided to merge both Robocop and Robotidy tools. This challenging decision was made for the following reasons:

* It's more efficient to maintain a single tool rather than two, as there was some code overlap between them
* Robotidy was developed after Robocop and used entirely different libraries and architecture for CLI and
  configuration management. Implementing the same feature in both tools resulted in duplicate effort
* This migration requires us to rewrite much of the code, providing a opportunity to redefine some of our core
  architecture
* We believe the merged tool will offer a significantly better user experience

Merging the tools means that:

* Robotidy is no longer developed and will now exist as 'Formatter' part of the Robocop
* Robocop is now split into two modes, 'Formatter' and 'Linter'

The basic usage is::

    robocop check
    robocop format

See detailed description for command changes.

Breaking changes
=================

Robocop --list is deprecated
-----------------------------

``--list`` option used to list available rules is now deprecated and replaced with ``list rules`` command::

    robocop list rules

Use it with ``--help`` for more information.

Robotidy --list is deprecated
-----------------------------

``--list`` option used to list available rules is now deprecated and replaced with ``list formatters`` command::

    robocop list formatters

Use it with ``--help`` for more information.

Linter configuration syntax change
-----------------------------------

Configuration syntax for ``--configure`` changed from::

    robocop --configure rule_or_report:param:value

to::

    robocop check --configure rule_or_report.param=value

Formatter configuration syntax change
-------------------------------------

Configuration syntax for ``--configure`` changed from::

    robotidy --configure formatter:param=value

to::

    robocop format --configure formatter.param=value

return_status report is now optional
-------------------------------------

Return status (exit code) of Robocop depended on internal, always enabled `return_status` report. It was calculated
based on parameter `quality_gate`. Default configuration::

    quality_gate = {
        'E': 0,
        'W': 0,
        'I': -1
    }

It means that any error or warning will count towards exit code. Information messages by default were not counted
towards exit code. Actual exit code is number of issues over set limit, up to 255 (for example with 'W': 100 and 105
warnings, exit code will be 5).

This behaviour wasn't clear to most, and makes Robocop unpredictable when run in CI/CD pipelines. That's why we are
now making `return_status` report optional. It means that now exit code follows different logic:

- 0, if no rule violations were found
- 1, if violations were found
- 2, if Robocop terminated abnormally

It is possible to always return 0, ignoring any violations, with new ``--exit-zero`` flag. The previous behaviour
can be reproduced by simply enabling ``return_status`` report again::

    robocop checks --reports return_status

compare_runs report is replaced with --compare
-----------------------------------------------

``compare_runs`` was special report that had to be enabled in order to compare reports results from current run
with previous runs. It was bit of a workaround, that's why it was removed.

To compare results, use ``--compare`` flag::

    robocop check --compare

Remember that you still need results from previous run (saved with ``--persistent``) and comparison is done on results
from the reports. Full example::

    robocop check --persistent --compare --reports all

(Robotidy) Formatter deprecated --transform option
---------------------------------------------------

``--transform`` option use to select formatters is now deprecated. It is replaced by ``--select`` which works similarly
but have one distinction - it does not support configuration.

Previous command::

    robotidy --transform YourTransformer:parameter=value --configure DefaultTransformer:other_parameter=value

Can be now achieved by::

    robocop format --select YourTransformer --configure YourTransformer.parameter=value --configure DefaultTransformer.other_parameter=value


New features
=============

Multiple configuration files
-----------------------------

Robocop can now use multiple configuration files. With the following example::

    project/
        file1.robot
        pyproject.toml  # config1
        subdir/
            file1.robot
            file2.robot
            pyproject.toml  # config2, excludes file1.robot

We will end up with the following files:

- project/file1.robot, using config1 configuration
- project/file2.robot, using config2 configuration

This feature allow to apply different configuration (for example exclude specific rules in the directory) for all
directories in your project.
